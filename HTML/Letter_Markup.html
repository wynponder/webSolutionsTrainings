    Re: Eileen Dover university application
  </h1>
  <p class="greeting">Dear Eileen,</p>
  <p class="paragraph-one">
    Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part </p> </p>of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD </abbr>next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
  </p>

  <h1 class="starting-dates">Starting dates</h1>

  <div class="second-paragraph">
    <p>
      We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if
      you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul class="dates">
      <li>First semester: <time datetime="2016-09-09">9 September 2016</time> </li>
      <li>Second semester: <time datetime="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</time> </li>
      <li>Third semester: <time datetime="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</time> </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br><br>
      You can find more information about <a href="https://awesomeuniversity.com">important university dates </a> on our
      website.

  <h1 class="subjects-of-study">Subjects of study</h1>
  <div class="third-paragraph">
    <p>
      At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall<br>
      somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br>
      the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most
      intrigued<br> by are as follows, in order of priority:
    </p>

    <ol class="subjects">
      <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)
      </li>
      <li class="subject-two"> Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C
        (86°F), when the <br> audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 ×
        10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
      <li class="subject-three"><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr
          title="Cascading Style Sheets"> CSS </abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the<br>
      research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
    </p>

  <h1 class="dance-moves">Exotic dance moves</h1>
  <p class="fourth-paragraph">
    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your
    question,<br> my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
  </p>
  <ul class="dance">
    <li class="dance-title">Polynesian chicken dance</li>
    <li class="dance-text">
      A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around<br> in
      a
      circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
    </li>

    <li class="dance-title">Icelandic brownian shuffle</li>
    <li class="dance-text">
      Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br>
      involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in
      imperceptibly<br>
      tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br> modern
      styles such as Twerking.
    </li>

    <li class="dance-title">Arctic robot dance</li>
    <li class="dance-text">
      An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br>
      discovered
      a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br> of Northern
      Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br> because they were
      really cold.
    </li>
  </ul>
