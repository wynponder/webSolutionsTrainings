    <h1>Wyn Ponder</h1>
    <h2>Web Developer</h2>
<div class="about-wyn-content">
    <p>Hi! I'm Wyn and I have a pretty atypical backstory for a web developer. I received a bachelor degree inSpanish
        and Journalism Major at my alma mater, Washington and Lee, but
        quickly realized that I wanted to enter a more challenging field that would require problem solving and
        continual learning, so she went to UVA to get her Master's in Commerce, with a concentration in Data
        Analytics.</p>
    <p>
        Upon receiving my Master's, I got a job offer at CapTech Consulting, which prompted my move to Richmond, VA. I
        began my career at CapTech in a Management Consulting role, and eventually switched to my company's Atlanta
        office. From there, I
        continued to move towards more technical work, namely as a Business Systems Analyst for a large utilities
        company in Florida. The nature of this engagement was exactly what I had been looking for - technical and
        challenging. This client engagement forced me to learn a variety of technical skills, which furthered my
        interest in technical work.
    </p>
    <p>
        My subsequent engagement was the first time I was staffed as a Project Manager, which was exciting, but I
        quickly realized that I found the work far less rewarding. I missed the technical nature of her past project
        almost immediately and missed the feeling of being constantly challenged. So, during the pandemic, with a lot of
        additional time on my hands, I looked into teaching myself how
        to code and do front-end web development. I tried learning python, but had a hard time motivating myself, so I
        started looking into HTML and CSS. After completing some initial online courses, I discovered an untapped
        interest in web development and with the help of my company, CapTech Consulting, I've started a journey to
        become a front-end web developer
